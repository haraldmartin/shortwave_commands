> Lines beginning with `>` are comments.

> Each command is defined on a single line comprised of:
> 
>   1. a case-insensitive, alpha-numeric trigger followed 
>      by whitespace
>   2. a url followed by whitespace (if the url contains 
>      spaces they must be encoded as `%20`)
>   3. a short description
> 
> Urls may contain the following replacement tokens:
> 
>   1. `%s` is replaced by any search terms that were
>       provided when a command is triggered.
>   2. `%r` is replaced by the url of the page you were on 
>       when Shortwave was invoked, eg. the `tr` trigger.
>   3. `%d` is replaced by just the domain of the url you were
>       on when Shortwave was invoked, eg. the `gs` trigger.
>   4. `%t` is replaced by the page title of the url you were 
>       on when Shortwave was invoked, eg. the `e` trigger.
> 
> A special `*` trigger can be used to define an untriggered 
> search. For instance, adding the following:
> 
>   * http://www.google.com/search?q=%s Untriggered search
>
> to your custom command file would allow you to do a Google
> Search by entering just a search term (without the `g` trigger) 
> in the Shortwave prompt.
> 
> The following default triggers do not need to be redefined 
> in your custom command file but they may be overridden. They 
> can be eliminated entirely by adding the following to the 
> top of your custom command file:
> 
>   > #kill-defaults
